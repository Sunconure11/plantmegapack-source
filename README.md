# plantmegapack-source
Plant Mega Pack 1.10 port.

I've created this repo because I think that letting projects die and keeping their code closed source doesn't benefit anyone. My hope is that PMP becomes a community-driven mod and that my role can simply be as someone who helped it get there. Any and all contributions are welcome. I'm still undecided on the best method to keep developing this mod, but for now this repo is mainly for bug fixes and small updates as Minecraft updates, not major changes to the project. I have also created https://github.com/larrythemodder/pmpnew where I have made a number of large changes to the mod, but I don't know if I'm going to keep working on that.
