# plantmegapack-source
Plant Mega Pack 1.10 port.

The purpose of this repo is to make the source code for PMP available for other modders to learn from and to work with. Dead mods remaining closed source benefits no one, this way they can still be part of the larger Minecraft mod codebase.

This repo is not under active development. It will be updated as new versions of Minecraft and Minecraft Forge are released, but no changes to the features of the mod are planned. The field guide has been disabled due to bugs. If anyone wants to fix this, that would be swell.
