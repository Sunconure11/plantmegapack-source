# plantmegapack-source
As close to original working source code as possible.

The purpose of this repo is to make the source code for PMP available for other modders to learn from and to work with. For those
in the future who might want to make their own versions or updates, or for those who want to borrow code to use in their own
mods. Dead mods remaining closed source benefits no one, this way they can still be part of the larger Minecraft mod codebase.
